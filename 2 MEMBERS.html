<br><font color="white" size="4">Just My Type
    M-m-m-m-m-my... more than meets the eye
    To tell the truth would be a lie
    I saw her out on Friday night, misunderstood
    She's balling for a guy
    That cigarette, it needs a light
    Pluck up the courage and invite her nowhere good
    
    'Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
    Need that honey when she hold my hand
    Times like this they call for true romance
    But she's not ready for that
    
    She lets me down
    Then gets me high
    Oh I don't know why
    She's just my type
    She's bad advice
    I don't think twice
    Oh I don't know why
    She's what I like
    
    But I, I, I love it
    I, I, I love it
    Love the way she plays with my head
    She lets me down
    Then gets me high
    Oh I don't know why
    She's just my type
    
    [Connor Ball:]
    This girl's still on repeat
    Plays in my mind, won't let me sleep
    She's not the one who's in my sheets
    'Cause she's no good
    She defies all of my dreams
    And expectations she won't meet
    I'll pack my bags and try to leave
    I wish I could
    
    'Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
    Need that honey when she hold my hand
    Times like this, they call for true romance
    But she's not ready for that
    
    [Bradley Simpson:]
    She lets me down
    Then gets me high
    Oh I don't know why
    She's just my type
    She's bad advice
    I don't think twice
    Oh I don't know why
    She's what I like
    
    But I, I, I love it
    I, I, I love it
    Love the way she plays with my head
    She lets me down
    Then gets me high
    Oh I don't know why
    She's just my type
    
    More than meets the eye
    To tell the truth would be a lie
    I saw her out again last night, misunderstood
    And I'll never be that guy
    That cigarette still needs a light
    And when I take her back to mine it's nothing good
