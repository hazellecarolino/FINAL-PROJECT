You're the wave upon my ocean
Pounding rhythm in motion
It's a full moon kinda night, yeah
I don't wanna go home yet
You can question my devotion
Wear my heart on my shoulder
Just relax and let the riptide pull you close

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, your body flows
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know

Feeling like I caught a wave with ya
I been dealing with a lot of changes
And all the people that I like to hang with
They all been sayin' that I ain't the same, listen
I been chillin' with you for a couple days
If you ain't afraid, me and you should rage
In the sun rays, come on out the cage
Don't want to tame, live it your way

Body go for days, got me in a daze
Parties in L.A. feel like holidays
Hit the PCH and we on our way
To a place I was born and raised
You live on the screen and the stage
I wanna fit in between in your legs
Let's pick a day, everything can wait
Words can't relate but it's giving fate

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, your body flows
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know
'Cause nothing feels as real when we're connected
Relax and let the riptide pull you close
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know

The stars come down, you drown them out
I'm sinking deeper into you
I breathe you in, I breathe you out
I'm sinking deeper into you

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, your body flows
We can cruise if the mood's right
Catch a wave under moonlight
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know
'Cause nothing feels as real when we're connected
Relax and let the riptide pull you close
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Baby all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know</font></br>
