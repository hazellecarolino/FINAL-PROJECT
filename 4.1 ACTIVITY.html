<br><font color="white" size="4">Pretty Girl
    Polaroid of you dancing in my room
    I want to remember
    I think it was about noon
    It's getting harder to understand, to understand
    How you felt in my hands (in my hands)
    
    I could be a pretty girl
    I'll wear a skirt for you
    And I could be a pretty girl
    Shut up when you want me to
    I could be a pretty girl
    Won't ever make you blue
    I could be a pretty girl
    I'll lose myself in you
    
    I was so blinded by you, now I cry
    Just thinking bout the fool that I was
    I was such a fool!
    I'm alone now but itâ€™s better for me
    I don't need all your negativity
    
    I could be a pretty girl
    I'll wear a skirt for you
    And I could be a pretty girl
    Shut up when you want me to
    I could be a pretty girl
    I'll never make you blue
    I could be a pretty girl
    I'll lose myself in you</font></br></p>

    Sometimes, you look the same
    Just like you did before the accident
    When you're starin' into space
    It's hard to believe you don't remember it
    Woke up in the ambulance
    You pieced it all together on the drive
    
    I know you don't remember calling me
    But I told you even then you looked so pretty
    In a hospital bed, I remember you said
    You were scared
    And so was I
    
    In a standstill on the 5
    Thought it was unusually early traffic
    Usually, I don't panic
    I just wanted to be on time
    When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
    I didn't even think of pullin' over
    I pieced it all together late that night
    
    And I know you don't remember calling me
    But I told you even then you looked so pretty
    In a hospital bed, I remember you said
    You were scared
    And so was I
    
    What if it happened to you on a different day?
    On a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way?
    Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
    Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
    What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
    What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
    If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
    You're alive, you're alive, you're alive
    
    And I know you don't remember calling me
    But I told you even then you looked so pretty
    In your hospital bed, I remember you said
    You were scared
    And so am I</font></br></p>
